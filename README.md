# 👋 Hi, I’m OrangeCantaloupe
👀 I’m interested in IT-security and data science.
<br> 🌱 I’m currently learning how to contribute to more projects to kickstart my learning and involvement in communities. I am new to programming and the IT field, but have dabbled in HTML, CSS and Python.
<br>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that help me evolve in my own learning.
<br>📫 You can reach me on discord at: Divine Star#2188 or join my discord server at https://discord.gg/27XVJ2XWyE
