# 👋 Hi, I’m OrangeCantaloupe
👀 I’m interested in IT-security, game development.
<br> 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make an indie game to kickstart my learning. I work as a Junior Cloud Engineer working with Azure, am new to programming but have some experience with Python and Bicep (for Azure infrastructure).
<br>💞️ I’m looking to contribute to the indie game
<br>📫 You can reach me on discord at: DivineStar.
